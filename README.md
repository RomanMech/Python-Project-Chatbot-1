# Python-Project-Chatbot-1

This Chatbot Responds And Memorizes User Input From Questions The Chatbot Will Ask The User, With The Use Of Strings Within User Input I Was Able To Make A Prompt With A Question From The Chatbot For The User To Answer To, Once The User Answers It Will Store The Data In A Variable I Assigned To That Prompt So The Chatbot Will Memorize It. The Questions Asked Consist Of Name, Age, Occupation and Favorite Color. Once The User Answers All These Questions The Chatbot Will Give An Overview Of The Stored Data Which Is The Answers To The Questions Provided To The User. I Made The Conversation As Human-Like As Possible By Utilizing Variable Assigning For The Favorite Color Section Of The Code To Green For The Chatbots Favorite Color. This Is My First Project Using Python
